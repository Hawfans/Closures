# Closures
Javascript assignment

###Description
This was an assignment where we had to create a website with some Javascript features. Creating responses to content being clicked on.

How the *first section* works:

1. First go to the [Site](http://hawfans.github.io/Closures/)
2. **Click** where the words ask you too. A number should appear.

The second section is a bit more tricky:

- **Click** on the heading of the second part.
- Once clicked the section will set off a delayed timer and will transfer into a loop that will continue until the it gets to the 5th number.
